# Dev Container Notes

This is a minimal Dev Container scaffold.

Current behavior:
- starts the DB via docker-compose
- mounts workspace into the container environment

TODO (once code is moved here):
- install Java + Maven toolchain in container
- install Node + npm toolchain in container
- add tasks to run backend/frontend inside container
