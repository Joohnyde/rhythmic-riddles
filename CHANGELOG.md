# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project does not yet follow a strict release cadence. When we start publishing tagged releases,
we will use a SemVer-like versioning scheme.

## Unreleased
- Documentation filled and aligned with current codebase (API, state machine, recovery, assets, security).
- Dev scripts for DB up/down and sanity checks.

## 0.1.0 (initial)
- Quiz-game backend + Angular frontend (TV/Admin) baseline implementation.
- Postgres persistence model with recovery-driven interrupts.
- WebSocket push for TV/Admin synchronization.
