# Prep App Guide (planned)

The Prep App is not implemented yet in this repository (`apps/prep-app/*` is a placeholder).

Goal of the Prep App:
- ingest songs from sources (YouTube/Spotify/Apple Music links or search)
- trim:
  - ~10s question snippet
  - ~6–7s answer snippet
- capture metadata (artist/title/genre/language/etc.)
- build albums (collections) and curate games

Once implemented, this guide will include:
- how to add songs
- how to create albums and cover images
- export/import flows for events
- where assets are stored (filesystem now; object storage later)

For now, see:
- `docs/developer-guide/assets-storage.md`
- `docs/developer-guide/architecture.md`
