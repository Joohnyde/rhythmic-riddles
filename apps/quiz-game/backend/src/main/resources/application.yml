              RhytmicRiddles is a live music quiz platform backend that powers pub-style
              song guessing games. It synchronizes a public TV display and a private
              Admin console, processes physical buzzer input, manages multi-stage game
              flow, evaluates answers, and guarantees seamless recovery from disconnects
              or crashes through persistent state tracking.
