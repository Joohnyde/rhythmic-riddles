# Bill of Materials (BOM)

This is a pragmatic BOM for the RhytmicRiddles 433MHz buzzer setup.

## Required
- 433MHz RF transmitter buttons (one per team)
  - Typical: “EV1527” style remotes
- 433MHz RF receiver module
  - Common: XY-MK-5V / RXB6 variants (any compatible with RCSwitch)
- Arduino (or compatible)
  - Arduino Uno / Nano (Nano is convenient for small footprint)
- Jumper wires (male-female)
- USB cable for Arduino → laptop

## Optional / recommended
- Breadboard (for clean wiring)
- Enclosure for receiver + Arduino
- Powered USB hub (if laptop ports are limited)

## Notes
Exact part numbers vary by region. The important compatibility constraint is:
- receiver must work with the `RCSwitch` library and your transmitters.
